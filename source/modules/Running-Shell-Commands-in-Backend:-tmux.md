# Running Shell Command in Backend
Sometimes, you might want to run a shell command but keep it in the backend. A reason might be so that you can quit the console and having the command to run continuously.

An easy way to do this is via tmux. 

## Step 1: Enter tmux

```tmux```

## Step 2: Execute your bash command 

## Step 3: If you now want to do something else in your shell
Press ctrl+B and then D to leave tmux

## Step 4: To reenter tmux and check the status
```tmux -a```
